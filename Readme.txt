Instructions on how to modify the input file are contained mostly within the input file.
Objective function: Please indicate if you wish for the z value to equal 0 by inputting 0z.
Constraints: Please leave a space between the constraint operators (<= , >= , ==).
Please denote "=" in a constraint as "=="

If a number is negative in an equation, please do x1+-x2 (x2 is negative) instead of x1-x2.

Examples:
Example minimization problem from pg 32 of notes:

Please input the objective function into the line below (no spaces):
0z=2x2+x2
Please indicate if the above function is a maximum or minimum (please write maximum or minimum below):
minimum
Please indicate how many constraints are present in the line below:
3
Please indicate the number of x variables in the constraints:
2
Please input the constraints into the line below (no spaces):
3x1+x2== 3
4x1+3x2>= 6
-1x1+-2x2>= -3

Example multiple optima maximization problem from notes:

Please input the objective function into the line below (no spaces):
z=x1+2x2
